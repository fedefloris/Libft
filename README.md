# Libft - 42Born2Code
My implementation of some of the Standard C Library functions + some additional ones.

## What is libft?
The goal of this project is to re-implement some standard C library functions + some additional ones that we'll be allowed 
to use in every project written in C.

For more details look at the [subject](subject.pdf)

## How do I use the library?
```
git clone https://github.com/fedefloris/Libft.git && cd Libft && make
```
Now you should see a '*libft.a*' file in the root folder.
